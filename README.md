# Amazon_Q_Sentiment_Analysis
Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Sagemaker Studio played a crucial role in carrying out the Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Q. With Amazon Comprehendâ€™s advanced NLP capabilities such as entity recognition, key phrase extraction, and sentiment analysis, I am able to uncover valuable insights from the tweets extracted from Twitter.

This mini-project came as a result of my curiosity with the whole hype of AI which seems to be dominating the technology landscape. Also as a Product Manager this is of importance in order to determine customer satisfaction and engagement and ultimately make data driven decision in order to scale the product/service. As a Data Analyst, just like how Duet AI is to Google Looker, that is how Amazon Q is to AWS Quicksight. This tool integrated with Quicksight provides real time and fast analysis of data in seconds. When a new product is released, there is a need to determine the business value of its customers. Sentiment analysis can help identify the overall sentiment towards the new product by analyzing customer opinions and emotions expressed in online reviews and social media posts.
